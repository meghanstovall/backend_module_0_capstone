## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

The purpose of a method is to perform an action that either uses the classes attributes or changes the attributes.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

    def hello
        puts "Sam I am"
    end


1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

    def hello_someone(name)
        puts "#{name} I am"
    end

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

hello_someone("Meghan")
